# Music Generation using Character RNN with LSTM:
The project implements character RNN with LSTM in Keras.  
Contains the data and the following files. The data is music in abc notations obtained from Nottingham Musical Database.
*http://abc.sourceforge.net/NMD/* <br>

1. *train_model.py* Trains the model with the given abc notations <br>
2. *generator.py* Generates new musical abc notations based on the model just trained.  

The generated files can be converted into audio files using any MIDI converter. 
*The code is a developed for a NLP project as a part of CSE 537 Natural Language Processing at Comnputer Scuience Department at Stony Brook University.*
